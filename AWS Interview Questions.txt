16: What is Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?
----------------------------------------------
Answer: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) is a logically isolated virtual network in the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources.
 Each VPC that you create is logically isolated from other in the AWS cloud. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. 
You can easily customize your Amazon VPC’s network configuration.


17: What are the components of Amazon VPC?
------------------------------------------
Answer: The main components of an Amazon VPC are -:

VPC: The Virtual Private Cloud itself is the main component. It is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources.
---
Subnets: Subnets are subdivisions of the VPC’s IP address range. You can create multiple subnets within a VPC, and they are typically associated with different availability zones.
--------
Route Tables: Route tables control the traffic between subnets within the VPC and between the VPC and the internet. Each subnet must be associated with a route table that specifies the routing rules.
------------
Internet Gateway: An Internet Gateway (IGW) is a horizontally scalable and highly available AWS-managed gateway that allows communication between your VPC and the internet.
-----------------
NAT Gateway: A Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway allows instances in your private subnets to communicate with the internet while blocking inbound traffic initiated from the internet. 
------------
It provides internet access for private instances without exposing their IP addresses to the public.

Security Groups: Security Groups act as virtual firewalls for your instances. They control inbound and outbound traffic based on user-defined rules. Each instance within a VPC is associated with one or more security groups.
----------------
Network Access Control Lists (ACLs): Network ACLs are stateless, subnet-level firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level. They provide an additional layer of security for your VPC by allowing or denying traffic based on rules you define.
------------------------------------
VPC Peering: VPC Peering enables you to connect multiple VPCs together, allowing them to communicate as if they were on the same network. It enables the resources in different VPCs to interact with each other using private IP addresses.
-----------
VPN Connections: Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections allow you to establish encrypted connections between your VPC and your on-premises network or other remote networks. It provides secure connectivity for resources in your VPC.
----------------


10.0.0.0 – Network address.
10.0.0.1 – Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.
10.0.0.2 – Reserved by AWS. The IP address of the DNS server is the base of the VPC network range plus two.
10.0.0.3 – Reserved by AWS for future use.
10.0.0.255 – Network broadcast address. It is not supporting broadcast in a VPC.



18: What is Load balancing?
---------------------------
Answer: Load balancing is the process of distributing incoming network traffic or computational workload across multiple resources, such as servers, to optimize resource utilization, improve performance, and ensure high availability of services.

Load balancers typically monitor the health and capacity of individual resources and direct traffic in a way that minimizes response time and maximizes throughput.



19: What is Auto Scaling?
------------------------
Answer: AWS auto scaling is a great feature that provides the ability to monitor your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.
With Auto-scaling you can scale out/in resources (servers, database, storage, etc.) 
automatically based on the pre-defined threshold for the metrics such as memory usage, network usage, CPU utilization.



20: What is Placement Group in EC2?
----------------------------------
Answer: In Amazon EC2, a placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. Using a Placement Group provides advantages such as reduced network latency and increased network throughput. It is a free feature currently available in Amazon EC2.

When an instance is stopped and restarted, it continues to operate within the same Placement Group. However, it is important to note that Instances from different Availability Zones cannot be added to the same Placement Groups,

21: What is Amazon S3?
---------------------
Answer: Amazon Simple Storage Service (s3) is an object-based storage. It provides secure, fast, highly scalable and durable platform to store any type of data. Amazon S3 allows users to create a bucket (storage resource) to store different types of data like videos, images, files, documents etc.

22: What is Versioning in S3?
-----------------------------
Answer: Users can enable versioning for s3 buckets to preserve every version of an object (user data) when an operation such as copy or delete is performed on it. Versioning means keeping the multiple forms of an object in the same s3 bucket.

You can use the s3 versioning feature to preserve, retrieve, and restore. Versioning is used to restore, retrieve and preserve every version of every object and through it, we can also recover from both unintended user actions and application failures.





23: What is Identity and Access Management (IAM)?
------------------------------------------------
Answer: AWS IAM is a fundamental component of AWS security, that helps you manage access to your AWS resources. IAM allows you to control who can access your resources and what actions they can perform. For example, a user allows to access EC2 service but deny to access S3 Service.

IAM enables you to create and manage users, groups, and roles that can be assigned specific permissions to access AWS services and resources,



Answer: Users – AWS IAM user is a unique identity with security credentials like a password or access & secret key. User is associated with permissions to control the use of AWS resources.
-------------
Groups – A user group can contain many users. You can grant permissions to group using access control policies, assigned permissions applicable to all users belongs to that group.
------
Roles – An IAM role is like an IAM user, Roles are used to delegating access to AWS resources and AWS Users temporarily instead of sharing credentials. A role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.
------




24: Explain AWS IAM Policies?
----------------------------
Answer: AWS IAM policies are JSON documents that define permissions and access controls for AWS resources. They determine what actions users, groups, and roles can perform on specific resources within your AWS account.

By default, Users, groups, and roles have no permissions, you need to assign the right policies to enforce security and compliance requirements within your organization.

AWS policies are of two types –
-------------------------------

Identity-based policies: Identity-based policies are attached to AWS identities like user, group, or role.
-----------------------
Resource-based policies: Resource-based policies are attached to the AWS resources like Amazon S3 buckets, VPC endpoints, Amazon SQS queues, AWS KMS, and other services.
-----------------------




25: What are IAM users’ access and secret keys?
----------------------------------------------
Answer: IAM users’ access and secret keys are credentials used for programmatic access to AWS services and resources.

Access Key: An access key is a unique identifier associated with an IAM user or an IAM role. It is a long string of characters (e.g., AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE) that is used to authenticate requests made to AWS services.

Secret Key: A secret key is a cryptographic key associated with an access key. It is a separate, confidential value (e.g., wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY) that must be kept secure. The secret key is used to sign the requests made with the access key, providing a form of authentication.





26)How do you monitor user activity with IAM?
--------------------------------------------
Answer: Monitoring user activity and roles is an important task for IAM managers. By using monitoring features, you can see what IAM users are doing, spot any unusual or unauthorized actions, and make sure security rules are followed. Monitoring user activity helps keep your AWS environment safe and secure.

You can use following services and tools to monitor User’s activity –

AWS CloudTrail: CloudTrail records API activity within your AWS account, including IAM user activity.
--------------
IAM User Activity Reports: IAM provides user activity reports that give you insights into the activity of IAM users in your AWS account.
--------------------------
CloudWatch Events: You can configure CloudWatch Events rules to monitor and respond to IAM events.
